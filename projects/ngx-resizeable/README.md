## Description
This repository is a demo application built with Angular 20, showcasing a resizable component. The component is built with Angular CDK and allows the user to resize the component by dragging the corners. The component uses a library called `ngx-resizable` which is a wrapper around the Angular CDK. The library also is available on npmjs.com and can be installed.
